| Translation Files - Standard
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
|   Usually written for each Model, these files contain key value pairs of words 
|   or phrases specific to entity. Other words or phrases commonly used in the 
|   project should be stored in the appropriate core.php file. 
|   Keys should be kept short, for the sake of convenience, and the words 
|   should be non-arbitrary - i.e. useful and relevant to pages displaying 
|   Entity data. Nesting of keys is encouraged for groups by: business logic 
|   and/or parts of page.
