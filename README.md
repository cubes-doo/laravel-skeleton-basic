A Laravel starter project, for defining standards & kickoff speed :rocket:

*Read this in other languages: [Srpski](README.sr-lat.md), [Српски](README.sr-cyr.md)*

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project and help you get it up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that will tell you how to get a development env running.

Firstly, we need to pull a project instance from packagist

```
composer create-project cubes-doo/laravel-skeleton-basic newProjectName
```

Now, if you want to use docker, first pull docker utillity files from our 'docker-compose' git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/cubes-doo/docker-compose.git docker
```

Next, lets copy the `docker/.env.example` to a new `docker/.env` file

```
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
```

Now, something more exciting :grin:, lets start our docker container!

```
sudo docker/docker-start.sh
```

Since there could be some discrepancies between UID's on different machines, lets run:

```
cd docker ; ./docker-usermod.sh ; cd ../
```

just in case. The short explanation for this is: using this command ensures that you have the same privileges as a user in the docker shell, as you would on your own machine.

Now we can run:

```
sudo docker/docker-console.sh
```

to enter the docker container's shell, and then inside it, run:

```
composer install
```

in file .env in root check if APP_KEY has value (exmple: 'APP_KEY=base64:Q1teAHYgmZtZ5ZFD1CJZp8yzlQuBqUeXsz3Mn++/yl3='), if it doesn't also run:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

For making and filling your local database with test data you should run:

```
php artisan migrate --seed
```

and you are good to go!

The [theme](https://coderthemes.com/codefox/menu-dark/index.html) used on this project, developed by [Coderthemes](https://coderthemes.com/), isn't free. So, at least visually, this project won't be useful to you without a paid licence. If you are one of our colleagues here at [Cubes](https://cubes.rs/), position yourself on the `public/` folder:

```
cd public
```

and proceed to clone it from its gitlab repository like so:

```
git clone git@gitlab.cubes.rs:web/laravel-skeleton-theme.git theme
```

Go ahead, log in and explore! By default, the project is exposed to http://localhost:7737. If this is no good for you, please refer to `docker/.env` & `.env` files to change it.

## Running code checks

Currently we are only using [FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer), as a composer dependency. You'll find the ruleset at `.php_cs`. 

There are also two commands of note to make code checking easy:

```
sudo docker/docker-php-cs-check.sh
```
> does a dry-run of php-cs-fixer, only telling you what should be changed

and
```
sudo docker/docker-php-cs-fix.sh
```
> actually fixes the code using php-cs-fixer

## Running the tests

We created a script, that runs tests inside the Docker container:

```
sudo docker/docker-unit-test-run.sh
```

This script will run all exposed tests in the `tests/` folder.

## Deployment
